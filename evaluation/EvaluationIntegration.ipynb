    "To evaluate the soft query evaluation system we create queries, encoded as evaluation plans, and execute them on a [hand-crafted schema](https://github.com/HackerBschor/SofteningQueryEvaluation/blob/main/evaluation/schema.json).\n",
    "The queries result set $R$ is then compared against the ground truth set $G$ to determine the true positives $TPs = R \\cap G$, the false positives $FPs = R \\setminus G$ and the false negatives $FNs = G \\setminus R$. Using these sets, we can calculate the following metrics:\n",
    "1) Precision: $\\frac{|TP|}{|TP| + |FP|}$\n",
    "2) Recall: $\\frac{|TP|}{|TP| + |FN|}$\n",
    "3) F1: $\\frac{2 \\cdot Precision \\cdot Recall}{Precision + Recall}$\n",
    "4) Jaccard-Coefficient: $\\frac{|TP|}{|G \\cup R|}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we collect the runtime, to compare it with the execution time of a query that replaces all soft bindings with strict bindings and therefore, doesn't utilize LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "The schema is created to maximize **Cross-Domain Generalization**, in order to simulate a real world application of the software.\n",
    "Therefore, we include data from different domains such as:\n",
    "1) Medicine\n",
    "2) Chemistry\n",
    "3) E-Commerce & Retail\n",
    "4) Social Media & User-Generated Content\n",
    "5) Geography\n",
    "6) Entertainment & Media (Movies/ Music)\n",
    "7) Sports & Gaming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Criteria\n",
    "We identified 8 different test criteria, where the usage of soft bindings can benefit the final result. We try to involve all test criteria in every domain to maximize the significance for every domain.\n",
    "We define the test criteria as follows:\n",
    "1) Semantic Matching ('Movie about toys that come to life' $\\rightarrow$ Record of 'Toy Story')\n",
    "2) Spelling Variations & Typos ('Aple' $\\rightarrow$ 'Apple', 'Neighbour' $\\rightarrow$ 'Neighbor')\n",
    "3) Synonyms & Conceptual Overlap ('High Blood Pressure' $\\approx$ 'Hypertension', 'Laptop' $\\approx$ 'Notebook')\n",
    "4) Aliases ('Lady Gaga' $\\approx$ 'Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta', 'J. Smith' $\\approx$ 'Jane Smith')\n",
    "    5) Abbreviations & Acronyms ('NYC' $\\approx$ 'New York City', 'Dr' $\\approx$ 'Doctor', 'AI' $\\approx$ 'Artificial Intelligence')\n",
    "6) Different Languages (Apple $\\approx$ Apfel $\\approx$ Mela)\n",
    "7) Unit & Format Inconsistencies ('2007-06-29' $\\approx$ '06/29/2007' $\\approx$ 'June 29, 2007' $\\approx$ '29.06.2007' $\\approx$ '29. Juni 2007', '2.2 lbs' $\\approx$ '1 kg', '1M' $\\approx$ '1.000.000' $\\approx$ 1000000)\n",
    "\n",
    "The defined test criteria mostly tests for semantic equality $\\approx$. However, a database also offers operators like $<$, $>$, $!=$.\n",
    "So, if applicable, we also include range queries and queries for semantic inequality. These range queries are mostly affect the criteria `Unit & Format Inconsistencies`."
